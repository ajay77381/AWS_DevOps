An incident is something that affects a service (so a user, system, etc) - something that impacts productivity. Generally it is the effect.
A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents.

 

2) Difference in Incident and problem.

 

In simple words any issue which is affecting only you as a individual is a Incident however if the same issue is affecting a larger audience is a Problem.

 

3) Relation between Incident and Problem.

Now let suppose 1 user creates a Incident for outlook issue and then 100 of users create an incident with the same issue. So you create a Problem for all the incidents link all 100 incident to one Problem record and solve the issue using the problem. So when you close the problem it will close  all the incident as well.

An end-user by process should create a Incident and the agents who work on Incident should create the problem if they see a recurring pattern on incident.

They are created by users from Portal using record producer of ITIL users directly in the platform and once the issue is resolved they are closed by the agents.
