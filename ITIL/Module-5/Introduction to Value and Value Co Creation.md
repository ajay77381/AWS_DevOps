Value co-creation organization, consumers, customer, and other stakeholders. Learning objective, in this module, we will talk about the understanding of value, perception of the stakeholders. Differentiating customers or consumers of a service or part of the service provider organizations. In this module, we will discuss about the introduction to value and value co-creation, definition, and importance of value co creation. Examples of how value is collaboratively created with stakeholders, definition and roles of service providers in ITIL, importance of service providers in the service value chain. The role and expectations of service consumers, managing and meeting customer expectations. Overview of other stakeholders and their impact on services.

In this lesson, let's look at the introduction to value and value co-creation. We can also look at the definition and importance of value co-creation. Let's look at a few examples of how value is collaboratively created with stakeholders.

Introduction to value and value co-creation. While some customers may think that providers are delivering value on their own, value is actually a dialogue and an active partnership between providers and customers. Value needs to be agreed upon by all parties in order to meet the real needs of the customer and to ensure consistency and flexibility which will enable you to co-create value together with the customer. In the past, providers could build services and provide value, but organizations that only think from their own point of view risk lagging behind the rivals. Instead, the service providers must understand the ever changing point of view of their customers. In today's fast paced world, it's important to be aware of today's needs as well as tomorrow's. That's how a company such as Uber was able to deliver on its promise of on demand door to door service while responding to customer demand, and outshining traditional taxi companies in the process. Similarly, Zomato and Swiggy is also an example where the food is delivered door to door. Close relationships between all those involved in service management are necessary to co-create value so that services can keep pace with customer needs. In modern world, the technology has improved a lot. We can also order anything that we want through E-commerce or even if we need food, we can use the service from Zomato or Swiggy, where the vendor can deliver the required food to the customer's location with just a click of a button.


## Definition and Importance of Value Co-Creation Part 1

 definition of value -
 
 Value is defined as the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. The perceived benefits mean from the point of service consumers. Whatever service they're consuming, they will look at what is the benefit that they're getting out of the service. The service consumer also looks at the usefulness of the service that is being provided. They also look at the importance of the service that is being provided. All these put together will deliver value to the customer from the service that they receive. Let's look at few advantages of implementing the value co-creation in the organizations. By co-creating value in organizations using ITIL 4, we can identify impactors and influencers with whom to co-create value. In a service organization, the service provider will provide the service to the service consumer. However, there are also other stakeholders involved in this journey. For example, there could be a vendor or a third party organization which will be involved in delivering those service. We can identify who are all the impactors and who are all the influences among those vendors and third party service providers. This will help us identify how to co-create value by delivering it to the customer. By co-creating value, we can also identify the digital service fragility and any critical incidents before they occur. For example, an IT organization, we may provide an IT service to the service consumer. While we provide the application up time as a service, we can also give them the option to move to a digital service where the service consumption could be much faster, feasible and relevant to the modern world. We can also set up a command center, set up alerts for critical components such as a server or if there is a application that is very critical for consumer business, we can set up alerts such as critical, high, medium, and low. While the critical alert will be taken up very quickly and the critical alert should be resolved before even a major incident occurs. This will ensure the business downtime is contained. By co-creating value, we can also improve the service availability and response through proactive analysis. By proactive analysis, we can look at what was done in the past, was there any major incident that occurred in a specific timeframe? We can look at which server was failing and what are all the actions that need to be taken to ensure that doesn't repeat in the future. By doing this analysis, we can help customer with the utmost service availability. Shift value left into the digital service strategy and design phase, increasing development velocity while reducing risk. The core purpose of moving into the digital service is to ensure the speed of delivery is maximized. At the same time, we would also be focusing on reducing the risk. By co-creating value, we also improve the organizational collaboration and communication. This means the service provider, the service consumer, the vendors and third party service provider who are all involved in the service delivery will be in same page wherein they can collaborate and communicate in a single platform. This will help the communication flows across all the group without any delays. And the message that gets transmitted will also be accurate that the service delivery will provide a value to the service consumer. By co-creating value, we can also turn failing vendor agreements into thriving commercial partnerships. This means we can regularly meet with the vendor and see the value that we are providing to the service consumer is up to the mark, or is there any gaps that need to be addressed immediately. By having these conversations, we will ensure that there is a commercial partnership involved. Finally, we would be able to alter the image of supposed failing teams through improved relationships and management information. Like we discussed earlier, if there is a single platform through which all the stakeholders are communicating, the message that is sent across is shared without any delays, and it will be an accurate message that the service consumer will get the desired value.

 ## Definition and Importance of Value Co-Creation Part 2

 definition for value and benefits of value co-creation.
 
 Value co-creation vastly reduces the gap between those designing and operating digital services and their organizational customers. Let's look at an example.
 
 In the IT service-providing industry, there is a designing team, which is called as pre-sales team, and there is another entity within the service-provider organization, which is called as the operating team.
 
 Consider a scenario where customer is looking for a digital service- 
 
 The service provider team will initiate discussion with the pre-sales team to look into that requirement. Pre-sales team will connect with the customer, understand the requirement, and then discusses internally within the service provider organization. There will be a team of expert who will review the requirements from the customer and provide their solutions. Multiple analysis will take place, the solutioning team will provide those solutions, and the presales team will gain the approval from the sponsors within the service provider's organization and gets back to the customer with the solutions from their rent as part of the digital service. If the customer agrees to the solution provided by the presales team, they proceed to sign an agreement with the service provider organization. Now, once the service provider organization gets into an agreement with the customer, the same blueprint will be provided to the operating team. The operations team will look at the service agreement and connects with the customer, understands their environment. They set up tools and process and start interacting with the customer as part of the service delivery. Here, there are two parties involved with the customer. One, the pre-sales team who provide the solution, and the other, the operating team who are delivering those solutions as part of the service agreement. The perception from the customer when they had a conversation with pre-sales team and the result that they are seeing on the ground from the service delivery of the operations team, there could be a gap. By value co-creation, we ensure that the values are discussed with the customer throughout the journey of this service delivery, and it ensures that both the pre-sales team, the service delivery team, and the customer, all are on same page throughout the journey. This ensures the gap is not there, and the value is seen by the customer as intended. Organizations recognize that value is co-created through an active collaboration between providers and consumers, as well as other organizations that are part of the relevant service relationships. 
 
 For example, in an IT organization, if there is a service agreement with the consumer, the service provider organization initiates a scheduled cadence meeting. It could be a monthly meeting, or it could be a quarterly governance meeting. As per the agreement with the service consumer, the service provider will have those cadence meetings. Here, they can discuss on the overall service delivery, including the in-flight projects, risk, escalations, any major incidents, and any help needed from the service consumer. While having this cadence meeting, service provider should ensure there is active participation from service consumer, the third party, and the vendors. During this, if there is any challenges that needs to be discussed, will be discussed and actions taken to overcome those challenges must be agreed and the same challenges and the actions that are arising out of this will need to be discussed in the subsequent meetings until closure. This will ensure there is an active collaboration between the provider, consumers, and other stakeholders in the service relationship. Providers should no longer attempt to work in isolation to define what will be of value to their customers and users but actively seek to establish mutually beneficial interactive relationships with their consumers. This means the service provider should not assume or presume what is value provider to the customer. If at all, they presume, they also have to discuss with the service consumer or user to tell that this is the value that arises out of the service. If the service consumer is okay with the value being projected, then both the service provider and the service consumer is on same page. However, if the service customer is not in agreement with the way the value is perceived, then customer will have an opportunity to explain to the service provider what is the expectation. This will ensure both the service provider and the service consumer is in agreement as what is perceived as value as part of the service delivery. This will also ensure the discussions are mutually beneficial, and the relationship is interactive and helps the service delivery process.


## Examples of How Value is Collaboratively Created with Stakeholders Part 1


 The example of value to the stakeholders. Here we can see the list of stakeholders. Number 1, service consumers. Service consumers are those who take the service from the service provider and perceives the value out of the service. The examples of value for service consumers are the benefits achieved, the cost, and the risk optimized. Second one, we have service provider. Service provider are those who provides the service to the consumers, They provide the service along with third-party service organizations along with the vendors and other shareholders. The value for service providers are funding from the consumer, the business development, branding, or image improvement. The funding from the consumer is called as the service fee. The third one we have in the list is service provider employees. The value for the service provider employees are financial and non-financial incentives, career and professional development, and sense of purpose. The employees of the service provider organization, will get both the financial and non-financial incentives based on their performance. There will be a target set for the productivity of the employees. If they achieve, they will get the financial incentives. If their performance are too good, they will be rewarded and recognized in the organization. If the performance is up to the satisfactory level and if they possess the leadership skills and the analytical skills required for the next level, they will get a promotion and there will be a career advancement. The job that they do on a regular basis will give them the sense of purpose being associated with the service provider organization. The fourth one we have in the list is society and community. The value for this stakeholder is employment taxes, organization's contribution to the development of the community. The service tax levied by the government will directly contribute to the development of the community. The fifth one we have in the list is charity organizations. The value for the charity organizations are financial and non-financial contributions from other organizations. The organizations which pay the service tax will also have tie up with the charity organizations and contribute to them in a financial way or provide them resources in a non financial terms. The last one we have in the list is shareholders. The value for this stakeholder community is financial benefits, such as dividends, sense of assurance, and stability. Any organization that gets listed in the stock market will have an opportunity for additional investments from the shareholders. The price of the stock increases as per the market rate. If the organization do well in their business, the value of the stock increases. Therefore, the shareholders also get benefited by getting the dividends sent to them.

examples of what all the values for the stakeholders. These examples of stakeholder value show fictional situations in which specific shareholder groups and companies benefited from the joint endeavors. Let's look at one example of discounts and sales. There was a shoe emporium which decided they wanted to achieve more sales in the third quarter to make room for new stock. According to the customer survey, discount initiatives may encourage more purchases. The shoe emporium offered a one weekend, 40% off sale on all items for all the customers, and an additional monthly mystery discount coupon for all customers who sign up for their e-newsletter. The shoe emporium tracks the number of customers who visit the store during the sale weekend. The number of mystery discount coupons used throughout the quarter and the total number of sales at the end of the quarter. Sales rose by 4% for the quarter from the same time the previous year. This is a value provided to the service consumer in written. There was a funding from the consumer to the service provider as well. Let's look at the second example for employee benefits. There was a marketing corporation which noticed a dip in employee productivity during the winter month for the last three years. After meeting with multiple teams, the team management found that the employees had to take more sick and personal time in the winter. This was because of the illness and poor travel conditions. Hence, the employees were not able to travel to work properly. However, this year, from December to March, the marketing instituted a work from home policy. This has allowed the employee to work remotely up to three days per week. They also offered $150 incentive to individuals whose team exceed their production goals. At the end of March, productivity among all the team increased 25% from the last three years. Here, the service provider employee saw the benefit of working from home and also got a $50 incentive for their higher production. Let's look at the third example purchasing in bulk. A vendor eatery uses a small local supplier for their fruits and vegetables. They make weekly purchases to meet their customer demand. The products arrives on time. However, it can take up to a month for the supplier to process the purchase order. This created confusion in the vendor accounting lecture. After talking with the supplier, the owner discovered they haven't had enough staff to both make timely deliveries and process the weekly payments. The owner and the supplier worked out a deal to purchase product in bulk at the beginning of the month and keep the same delivery schedule. After three months, deliveries continue to arrive on time and the supplier process purchase orders within ten days of payment. Here again, the service consumer and the service provider both got value out of this deal by purchasing in bulk. Let's look at the fourth example, a security grant funding. There was a community library which wanted to upgrade their computer system to provide faster Internet and more devices for patrons. Despite targeted fund raising efforts, they could not start the project on time. The new council president has been looking for ways to boost her approval ratings with residents. She receives an email from a global technology company asking for proposals for joint government community sponsored tech initiatives. She contacts the library to work on a joint proposal. The community library received the grant, which funded the purchase of an entire system upgrade, all new desktop computers, five new laptops, and three tablets. Under this grant, the library offers bimonthly technology classes for patterns of all ages. The council president's approval rating rose 10% following the grant reward. This is the financial and non-financial contributions from the other organizations.

Let's look at what stakeholder value is, how it differs from shareholder value, how to set stakeholder values, and examples showing how the mindset works in fictional situations. Stakeholder value is a business concept that companies use to create the best possible levels of return for their stakeholders. Businesses may use the three dimensions of value to figure the levels of return. Emotional returns are that offer security or good feelings to promote trust within an organization. Financial returns are related to money, functional returns that offer flexibility and choice to increase productivity. Some stakeholder values may put an emphasis on net profit or cash flow, while others can improve employee benefit plans. It also decrease the resource usage or tackle the social responsibility issues. Now let's look at the stakeholder mindset. Companies that have a stakeholder value mindset and the people who run them may share certain characteristics in their thinking and business practices. Let's see what are those. Stakeholders are adhering to a company morals or value system. Considering the societal and global effects a company can have on other entities. Promoting a free flow of ideas from all levels to increase the innovation. Recognizing and rewarding those who add value to the organization. Considering and discussing multiple options or approaches before making any decisions. Thinking of ways to make the organization competitive and sustainable.
