## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 1


## Definition of value- 
It is the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something. Perceived benefit means it could be from the view of the end user or the consumer. Usefulness is meant by the usefulness of the product or service that is being provided, and importance of something is what is being gained out of the product or service. This is called as value, the term value is used regularly in service management and it is a key focus of ITIL 4. This means that value can be anything and that it is something very subjective.

What can bring value for some can mean little to other stakeholders. For this reason, delivering value has to be in the center of attention at any moment while practicing ITIL, which is why focus on value is the first guiding principle of all seven ITIL guiding principles


Main concepts in ITIL 4 :

co-creating value within service management. Co-creating means it can be from the service provider, and it also can be from the service consumer. Both of them co-create value as per ITIL 4. Co-creating is part of the ITIL 4 guiding principle focus on value, which not only emphasizes on understanding what generates the most value in a service. But also helps practitioners to achieve that value, and optimize investments to maximize it for all parties.
     In short, co-creation means opening the dialogue in developing products and services, and recognizing value from customers perspective. Organizations recognize that value is co-created through an active collaboration between providers and consumers, as well as other organizations that are part of the relevant service relationship. This means one organization can have a relationship with another organization, and they both combine to create the value, that is called as value co-creation. Providers should no longer attempt to work in isolation to define

  what will be of value to their customers and users. But actively seek to establish mutually beneficial interactive relationships with their consumers. Value of service comes from what it enables someone to do and what the service is made of. A direct consequence of that is that it is the customer that determines the final value, and not the provider. For example, let's take the mobile service provider. The purpose of mobile service provider is to ensure that the end user gets the call with uninterrupted network. And they should be able to listen and speak over the phone, and that is the value of the service provider, 



   ## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 2

   
 The following terms generally characterize the value of a service.
 
 Number 1, the value is defined by the customer and enducer. We also have to make sure that the service provider is in alignment.
 
 Number 2, the value should have affordable mix of features. This means the value is created by all benefits of the features.
 
 Number 3, value should achieve the objective, the service provider should ensure that his product or service meets this requirement and achieve the objective.
 
 Number 4, value changes over time and circumstances. That means it is not static and it is dynamic, and the customer perception of value changes over time.

In order to achieve value, an open dialogue and active collaboration between provider and stakeholders is needed. Everyone needs to agree on what value means in order to be able to satisfy the genuine requirements of the customer. This means the service provider should also consider the feedback from stakeholders and also should be in alignment with what the customer is perceiving as value.

A definition of value is also needed in order to ensure a consistent and adaptable approach, which will allow ideal practitioners to co create value with the customer.

### Earlier days of service management-

providers would simply create the services that they thought delivered value. However, they only considered their own perspective as a service provider, they were more concerned about keeping up with competitors and their pricing than with satisfying customers with value.
Co-creating value helps to understand the constantly shifting perspective of customers. In earlier days in service management, they created a package and delivered it to the customer without even understanding the value. However, in the modern world, they understand that the package also has to be considered and the value is created. When defining value, the customer's input is important. However, there are also external factors to be considered, especially in the constant and rapidly changing world.

 The example for this will be the latest invention of Cloud computing Agile and DevOps. In the earlier versions of ITIL, these methodologies were not considered. However, in ITIL 4, they have considered all these components and integrated it in the ITIL 4 format.

If there is an open dialogue between the service provider and the stakeholders, they can include these external factors in their discussion and try to create value for anyone involved, even if that means constantly revisiting what is valuable. When the latest version of ITIL was launched, it was made sure a lot of Agile and DevOps oriented approaches were included. As we discussed earlier, this enables ITIL 4 practitioners to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in planning, designing, building, supporting, and improving the services. This makes sure that value is being co-created and value can be achieved for the customer, service, consumers, and the organization itself.


 ## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 3

value and value co-creation. 

What is value co-creation? How value cocreation is integrated in ITL4? Let's continue. Successful co-creation of services need a clear understanding of the fact that all stakeholders have a role to play. All stakeholders need to be heard and listened to. All stakeholders need to share information of needs and constraints that may impact the final service. In order to have this open discussion, relationship, need to be strong and resilient with confidence and trust from all parties involved. For example, in an organization, there will be a role of service provider, there will be a role for service consumers, and there is also role for the other stakeholders. IT environment, the service provider, the service consumer and the stakeholders such as third party vendors will all play a role in providing the final service to the customer. As mentioned here, we have to ensure there is an open discussion with the service provider, with the service consumer, and the vendors, all three sitting in a table and discussing on what is best for the customer. Here, they have to ensure that value is created by their service or product. The service provider should ensure that the vendors or third party or any other stakeholders is involved in providing the service to the customer.

## Provide support-

co-creation process and help sustain its success include co-creation needs an agile and flexible mindset. This means the service provider, the service consumer and the vendors, the third parties all have to be in alignment and they should have an agile and flexible mindset. They should be able to cope up with the modern changes.

Co-creation needs a positive approach. Constant disagreement does not help the process. This means any idea that is put forth on the table, be it from the service provider end or be it from other stakeholders, we have to take it positively, analyze it, and take the best decision which is going to provide the premium quality service or product to the customer.
And we also have to ensure there is no constant disagreement because that will delay the process. Co-creation comes with ups and downs and needs full engagement from all parties. This means co-creation will have multiple discussions. 

There can be delays, but we need to ensure that all parties attend the meeting and ensure that there is full engagement and commitment. Co-creation is successful when all inputs from all parties are heard, letting go of control is key. In uncollaborative meeting, we have to ensure that all parties are heard. That means they should be able to voice out their opinion and it should be considered during the course of the meeting and the service provider will have to ensure that they do not take control of the meeting. 

Instead, ensure that all these valuable inputs are taken into consideration. Co-creation means not strictly following the process, but flowing with the tides of the stakeholders included. There can be a written process on how a meeting to be conducted and there could be multiple pool objectives that could be discussed on the table. However, we need to ensure that following the process is not the key. However, the stakeholders should be heard and the customer should get the premium quality services and product and the service provider should ensure this is done.
