## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 1


## Definition of valu- 
It is the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something. Perceived benefit means it could be from the view of the end user or the consumer. Usefulness is meant by the usefulness of the product or service that is being provided, and importance of something is what is being gained out of the product or service. This is called as value, the term value is used regularly in service management and it is a key focus of ITIL 4. This means that value can be anything and that it is something very subjective.

What can bring value for some can mean little to other stakeholders. For this reason, delivering value has to be in the center of attention at any moment while practicing ITIL, which is why focus on value is the first guiding principle of all seven ITIL guiding principles


Main concepts in ITIL 4 :

co-creating value within service management. Co-creating means it can be from the service provider, and it also can be from the service consumer. Both of them co-create value as per ITIL 4. Co-creating is part of the ITIL 4 guiding principle focus on value, which not only emphasizes on understanding what generates the most value in a service. But also helps practitioners to achieve that value, and optimize investments to maximize it for all parties.

     n short, co-creation means opening the dialogue in developing products and services, and recognizing value from customers perspective. Organizations recognize that value is co-created through an active collaboration between providers and consumers, as well as other organizations that are part of the relevant service relationship. This means one organization can have a relationship with another organization, and they both combine to create the value, that is called as value co-creation. Providers should no longer attempt to work in isolation to define

  what will be of value to their customers and users. But actively seek to establish mutually beneficial interactive relationships with their consumers. Value of service comes from what it enables someone to do and what the service is made of. A direct consequence of that is that it is the customer that determines the final value, and not the provider. For example, let's take the mobile service provider. The purpose of mobile service provider is to ensure that the end user gets the call with uninterrupted network. And they should be able to listen and speak over the phone, and that is the value of the service provider,
