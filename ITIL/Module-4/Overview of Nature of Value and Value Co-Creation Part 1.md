## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 1


## Definition of value- 
It is the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something. Perceived benefit means it could be from the view of the end user or the consumer. Usefulness is meant by the usefulness of the product or service that is being provided, and importance of something is what is being gained out of the product or service. This is called as value, the term value is used regularly in service management and it is a key focus of ITIL 4. This means that value can be anything and that it is something very subjective.

What can bring value for some can mean little to other stakeholders. For this reason, delivering value has to be in the center of attention at any moment while practicing ITIL, which is why focus on value is the first guiding principle of all seven ITIL guiding principles


Main concepts in ITIL 4 :

co-creating value within service management. Co-creating means it can be from the service provider, and it also can be from the service consumer. Both of them co-create value as per ITIL 4. Co-creating is part of the ITIL 4 guiding principle focus on value, which not only emphasizes on understanding what generates the most value in a service. But also helps practitioners to achieve that value, and optimize investments to maximize it for all parties.

     n short, co-creation means opening the dialogue in developing products and services, and recognizing value from customers perspective. Organizations recognize that value is co-created through an active collaboration between providers and consumers, as well as other organizations that are part of the relevant service relationship. This means one organization can have a relationship with another organization, and they both combine to create the value, that is called as value co-creation. Providers should no longer attempt to work in isolation to define

  what will be of value to their customers and users. But actively seek to establish mutually beneficial interactive relationships with their consumers. Value of service comes from what it enables someone to do and what the service is made of. A direct consequence of that is that it is the customer that determines the final value, and not the provider. For example, let's take the mobile service provider. The purpose of mobile service provider is to ensure that the end user gets the call with uninterrupted network. And they should be able to listen and speak over the phone, and that is the value of the service provider, 



   ## Nature of Value and Value Co-Creation Part 2

   
 The following terms generally characterize the value of a service.
 
 Number 1, the value is defined by the customer and enducer. We also have to make sure that the service provider is in alignment.
 
 Number 2, the value should have affordable mix of features. This means the value is created by all benefits of the features.
 
 Number 3, value should achieve the objective, the service provider should ensure that his product or service meets this requirement and achieve the objective.
 
 Number 4, value changes over time and circumstances. That means it is not static and it is dynamic, and the customer perception of value changes over time.

In order to achieve value, an open dialogue and active collaboration between provider and stakeholders is needed. Everyone needs to agree on what value means in order to be able to satisfy the genuine requirements of the customer. This means the service provider should also consider the feedback from stakeholders and also should be in alignment with what the customer is perceiving as value.

A definition of value is also needed in order to ensure a consistent and adaptable approach, which will allow ideal practitioners to co create value with the customer.

In the earlier days of service management, providers would simply create the services that they thought delivered value. However, they only considered their own perspective as a service provider, they were more concerned about keeping up with competitors and their pricing than with satisfying customers with value. Co-creating value helps to understand the constantly shifting perspective of customers. In earlier days in service management, they created a package and delivered it to the customer without even understanding the value. However, in the modern world, they understand that the package also has to be considered and the value is created. When defining value, the customer's input is important. However, there are also external factors to be considered, especially in the constant and rapidly changing world. The example for this will be the latest invention of Cloud computing Agile and DevOps. In the earlier versions of ITIL, these methodologies were not considered. However, in ITIL 4, they have considered all these components and integrated it in the ITIL 4 format.

If there is an open dialogue between the service provider and the stakeholders, they can include these external factors in their discussion and try to create value for anyone involved, even if that means constantly revisiting what is valuable. When the latest version of ITIL was launched, it was made sure a lot of Agile and DevOps oriented approaches were included. As we discussed earlier, this enables ITIL 4 practitioners to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in planning, designing, building, supporting, and improving the services. This makes sure that value is being co-created and value can be achieved for the customer, service, consumers, and the organization itself.
