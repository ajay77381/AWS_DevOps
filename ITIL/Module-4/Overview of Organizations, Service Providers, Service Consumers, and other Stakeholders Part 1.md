Learning objective -

 overview of organizations, service providers, service consumers and other stakeholders. We will also see what is meant by product and services.

## What is organization?

Organization is a person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities, and relationships to achieve its objectives. 
some of the examples of organization to understand it better. Associations, so any association that is formed to achieve an objective is an example of organization- 
Corporations, 
foundation,
even government is an example of organization. Non profit organizations and IT team. So even an IT team is called an organization because it has multiple group of peoples working to achieve an objective.

## Service provider ?

When provisioning the services, an organization takes on the role of the service provider. The provider can be external to the consumer's organization or they can both be part of the same organization. Let's look at an example where an IT team is delivering a service to the external stakeholder, that is external service provider. The example for internal service provider is an IT team providing their service to other departments within an organization, that is, internal service provider.

some of the examples of service providers. Healthcare facilities is also a form of service provision. Financial, cloud service, so in the modern world, we have Amazon Web Services, Azure. All of those are example of cloud service. Network service, Internet service. So these are all the examples of service providers. They make sure they deliver the service to the end user or the consumer and provide the appropriate level of service in a given period of time

## Overview of Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and other Stakeholders Part 2-

## what are all the types of service providers available ?

### Type 1 service provider - 

It  is an internal service provider that is embedded within a business unit. There may be several Type 1 service providers within an organization.

### Type 2 service provider- 

It is an internal service provider that provides shared IT services to more than one business unit. Type 2 service providers are also known as shared service units. In short, they are called as SSU. 

### Type 3 service provider- 

It  is a service provider that provides IT services to external customers. 

Now let's look at the examples of them. Type 1 service provider, internal service providers operate exclusively within their internal market space, which may be an internal business unit called as BU. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dc8ba49-eb21-4754-8f96-6b374f49ea83)



You can see that in the diagram represented. When one business unit starts to achieve large business growth and begins earning a big enough portion of the company's profit, that business unit wants to ensure that all necessary resources are under its own direct control. This leads to the creation of sub-departments with the single purpose of providing non-core services to their business unit. Examples are finance and administration, office management, customer care, human resources, fleet management, IT services, etc. You can see the sub-departments mentioned in the diagram. So these sub-departments are known as Type 1 service providers within ITIL best practice.

Let's move to Type 2 service provider, which is shared service units. In most cases, corporate functions such as finance, HR, or IT are not part of the core business service. Therefore, they don't need to be managed directly at the corporate business level. Internal providers are consolidated into a single unit, which will centrally provide the services to the whole organization. Within ITIL, we call those shared service units and they represent the Type 2 service provider archetype

Type 2 service providers have more autonomy in making their own internal strategies, decisions, and organizational structure that will serve business demands in the most efficient and optimized manner. You can see the examples of shared service unit in the diagram represented.

Let's move to third type of service provider, which is external service providers. When services are provided outside the company, it's Type 3 or external service provider. External service providers will deliver the same KPIs or other measurable objectives as Type 2 providers, which adopted best practice frameworks as ITIL. When looking at internal organization, external service providers are similar to Type 2 providers, but for multiple external companies. In the diagram represented, you can see the external service providers mentioned. They provide generic services, so the companies that use them have to find their own way in aligning those services with business needs.


## Overview of Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and other Stakeholders Part 3 -

 let's talk about service consumers and other stakeholders.
 
## Who are all service consumers? 

When receiving services, an organization takes on the role of the service consumer. Let's look at some examples of service consumers. 

In retail, customers are called as service consumer. In health care, the patients who are receiving the treatment is called as service consumer. In education, the students who enroll for the courses are called as service consumers.

Mobile phone users are called as service consumers. Television channel subscribers are called as service consumers.

In an IT environment, the end users who use the services of IT are called as service consumers.

Let's look at the two types of consumers according to ITIL. 

## 1- One is the internal consumers
## 2- other one is an external consumers

## who are all internal consumers?

Any service provider organization will have its own users who need to be taken care of. The users could be part of the support team or from project teams.

As you service the users within your own organization, these customers are called as internal customers.

## who are all the external service consumers? 

If the consumer resides outside the IT service provider organization, then the consumer is called as an external customer. The external consumer pay for the services with a set SLAs and they tend to impose penalties when the service targets are not met.

Let's also look at some key definitions in ITIL with respect to service consumers-

Number 1 is a customer-  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcome of the service consumption is called a customer.


### User - User is a person who uses these services. Sponsor. Sponsor is a person who authorizes the budget for service consumptions. Let's look at the real world example of customer, user, and sponsor. 

For example, in an IT organization, they plan to purchase a laptop for their end users. They approach the laptop manufacturing company and they procure a set of laptops for their end users. Here the laptop manufacturer is the service provider. The IT team which procures the laptop is the service consumer. Or here, as per the ITIL definition, they are called as customer.

## Who is the user?

The end user who are going to use the laptop is called as user as per the ITIL definition. Before procuring the laptop, there will be an approval process in place where the business unit head will review the quotation and he will allocate budget to procure the laptops. This person is called as a sponsor.

Let's move to other stakeholders.

Beyond the consumer and provider roles, there are usually many other stakeholders that are important to value creation. Let's look at some examples. Individual employees of the provider organization , partners and suppliers, investors and shareholders, government organizations such as regulators , and social groups.

Let's look at the internal stakeholders. They are those that work within the same organization. Let's think of the employees of the ITIL within organization, the team, the management, the partners, et cetera. When speaking about internal IT providers, they can also be the internal customers. Let's look at who are all the external stakeholders. They are those that are not part of the same organization and these stakeholders can be external customers or they can be users, suppliers, and vendors



## Overview of Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and other Stakeholders Part 4 -


 ## stakeholder management and the key aspects of stakeholder management in ITIL- 
 
 For the success and even the continued existence of an organization, it is important that relationships with all key stakeholders are understood and managed. If the stakeholders are unhappy with what the organization does or how it does it, the provider's relationship with its consumers can be in jeopardy.

Products and services create value for stakeholders in a number of ways. Some are quite direct, such as the generation of revenue, while the others are more indirect, such as employee experience. 

For example, let's take the work of a call center. The role of the agent is to ensure that they resolve the customer issues. However, the agent also need to ensure that the customer is satisfied with this approach.


## What is Products and services Part 1 -

 What is a product? 
 
 Let's look at it from an example. You can go into a store and purchase a laptop. The laptop represents a product. Does it mean that products have to be tangible? Not really. In the same store, you can also purchase an MS Office 2019 software. Software is intangible, but yet it is a product.
 
 A product is something that you can buy once and use it for as long as you need to. Provided the laptop or the MS Office software stays relevant 10 years from now or even 20. Service provider organizations have different types of resources like, people, technology, networks, storage, and so on. They combine and configure these resources in order to create products. Products are a configuration of resources that have potential value for customers. These products in of themselves do not create value or generate value for customers. In order to be able to do that, the service provider describes the outcomes that can be achieved by using these products in the form of service offerings. These service offerings describe the quality, cost, timeliness, risks associated with using these products and customer look at these service offerings to decide which is the best one for them. Once they have selected a service offering, the customer and the service provider enter into what's called a service relationship. It is in that service relationship, the value gets generated. Value gets generated for the customer through the outcomes they want to achieve the value and that gets generated for the supplier through the outcomes they want to achieve. But value is also generated for other stakeholders in this ecosystem.
​

## What is Products and services Part 2

## what is service ?

We will continue with the same example as we saw for the products. The laptop you purchased refuses to turn on two months after the purchase, you call in the support desk and they resolve the issue by sending a technician to your home the next day. This activity around fixing the issue is called a service. 

   In this case, it was offered to you along with the product. Generally speaking, a service is a separate entity and need not be coupled with the purchase of a product. Let's also look at few other examples for service-
   
   Consider, you purchased a TV set top box. That TV set top box is a product, however. For the subscription channels, if you want to add, modify, or delete any of the channels, you call the customer care and then they provide you the service by adding or modifying or deleting those channels. For that they collect a subscription fee. This is an example for a service. Let's look at another example. Consider you've purchased a flat or an apartment. In this case, flat or an apartment is called a product. But if you have any issues with your electrical works or your plumbing works, you request the maintenance team to provide you a repair service. This is an example for a service. The maintenance fee that they collect on a regular basis is called a maintenance service fee.

Now that we've seen what the products and services are, now let's look at some key aspects of products-

A product is more frequently a one-off purchase while a service can be recurring. As we saw in the previous example, the TV set top box is purchased only once. However, the subscription channel modification is a recurring one, so that is, a service.

A product can be returned while a service has to be canceled usually with notice. Again with the same example, you can surrender your TV set top box. However, a service has to be canceled. This means you can change your subscription from one format to another.

A product has many different variations while a service is more standard and straightforward.

Understanding the difference between products and services is vital for any business that wants to succeed. By being aware of these distinctions, companies can tailor their strategies to meet the specific needs of their customers and optimize their process for maximum profitability.


## What is Products and services Part 3 - 

we will see how products and service are interrelated.

When examining many instances of products and services, it becomes clear that while a graphic designer offers a service, the end result is typically a tangible product, such as new business cards, brochures or logos. Alternatively, a legal firm might offer legal services, but that could also result in written correspondence like contracts and letters. Thus, it is possible to combine services and product.

For example, think of a subscription meal kit. The subscription itself is a service that provides meal preparation products. Let's look at how ITIL is viewing the products and services together. ITIL is a service management framework, meaning it is all about services. 

For example, if you look at ITIL Version 2, it had service support and service delivery as the core component. In ITIL V3 they had five life cycles such as service strategy, service design, service transition, service support, and continual service improvement. Since products are no longer simply products but rather services, it falls under the service management pace of ITIL. ITIL has become even more powerful contrary to what people believe that digital transformation is going to make ITIL less relevant. The strategy and design of services cannot be done in isolation anymore. It needs to be done hand in glove with the product development

## What is Products and services Part 4

## What is a product?

 It is a configuration of an organization resources designed to offer value for a consumer.

 ## What is  service ?
 
 It is a means of enabling value creation by facilitating outcomes that customer wants to achieve without the customer having to manage specific cost and risk. All products manufactured by a company are designed to meet the specific needs of the target consumer base.
 
 For example, in case of mobile users, the products that manufactured by a company is a mobile phone, and the targeted consumer base is the person who used the mobiles. These features and functions are unique to each product. Additionally, the goods are tailored to meet the customer needs. Let's look at an example. An enterprise network uses a router with certain features and functionalities such as port count and IOS and these are customized. For example, IP address, routing, et cetera, to meet the needs of the business. 
 
      When a product is created, it is meant to serve multiple distinct customer groups rather than being used exclusively by one. The product will consist of multiple parts, some of which will be visible to customers and some of which won't. The portions of the product that are visible to customers do not include every component. It includes every element required for that product to function. The product is configured by the user to meet their needs.
      
      Now let's look at services. Similar to product, services are also composed of numerous components such as products and services. This is where the products and services get interlinked. The interface that customer use to access the service will only include those interfaces that are necessary to use the service. It will not include all of the components. Let's look at an example.
      For instance, the Intranet portal used by the organization's employees to access the HR services. The Intranet portal serves as the service interface in this case, and the presence of servers, LAN service, and other components guarantees that employees may access the service. Now let's look at the service offerings based on the products and services. Service providers present their services to consumers in the form of service offerings, which describe one or more services based on one or more products. Now let's look at the definition of service offerings as per ITIL. It is termed as a formal description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include: goods, access to resources, and service actions. Now let's look at service relationships. To create value, an organization must do more than simply provide a service. It must also cooperate with the consumers in service relationships. For example, if you buy a set up box, the customer will also look forward to the after sale services. For example, if you need any addition deletion or modification of channels, they expect the customer care to provide that service. Service relationships are established between two or more organizations to co-create value. In a service relationship, organizations will take on the roles of service providers or service consumers. The two roles are not mutually exclusive, and the organizations typically both provide and consume a number of services at any given time. For example, in an IT environment, if there is a niche skill involved and if the current organization does not have the capable resource to deliver that service, they outsource it to another organization. In that case, the outsourced organization will be the service provider and the organization which has outsourced will become the service consumers.

## What are the service relationship ?

Service relatioship is  a cooperation between a service provider and service consumer. Service relationship include - Service provision. Service consumption and service relationship management. 
The model of engagement that the service provider and the customer will have in order to co-create value is referred to as service relationship. And corporations need to constantly aim to do more than only render services. To produce service value, teamwork and a group effort are required. Organizations must envision the alignment and value cascade impact from organization to organization and co-create value in order to form service connections.

The goal of a service relationship should be value creation between the firms or service providers and customers or service consumers. Although an organization typically delivers and consumes a variety of service at any given time, these dual responsibilities are not mutually incompatible.

## What is service provision ?

Service provision refers to the activities performed to provide service to service consumer by a service provider organization. This includes oversight of every resource used by the service provider and set up to supply the service. In other words, supplier services, hardware, and software, et cetera. Providing users, for example, the service consumers, access to these resources such as previously stated cloud services. Carrying out the agreed upon service actions in order to achieve the desired service outcome such as incident resolution or service component configurations, et cetera.

Over the course of the service lifecycle, all services are provided and monitored and service levels and performance are continually improved. It might also refer to the supply of commodities such as the supply of items that customers order via online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay.

## What is  service consumptions ?

 Activities performed by an organization to consume services, service consumptions includes management of the resources needed by the customer to access and use the services. An instance of a consumer resource could be a network switch or router that connects to an internet service provider's internet services so that users can access them. User performed service actions include making use of the resources provided by the provider and making requests for service actions to be completed. For instance, using a web browser to open the portal and inputting the logging information to access a bank account using the net banking services. Consuming services might also involve obtaining or purchasing things. For instance, visiting an e-commerce gateway such as the websites for Amazon or eBay and placing an order for commodities or products. 
 
## What is  service relationship management ?

As we previously stated, both the service provider and the service user must carry out the necessary task to guarantee continuous co-creation of value. They must also guarantee that the services meet predetermined service levels and are accessible in accordance with predetermined service offerings. Every time a service provider provides a customer with a service, the provider must provide new resource to facilitate the service for the customer, giving the customer the platform they need to alter or personalize their current services. This would make it possible for a service provider's customer to receive services from them as well.



## Value
## Outcome
## Cost
## Risk

## What are Values? 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3e8767-5ade-4d29-b0fc-3c884d9528f4)

You can see there are value additions in the right-hand side, which are supported outcomes, cause removed, risk removed. However, in the left-hand side, you can see what are all the factors that impacts the value. You have affected outcome, cause introduced, risk introduced. It's interesting to realize that a service worth extend beyond its development when one understands the fundamental ideas of IT service management. Value is subjective and depends upon the people and organizations using the services. To gain a better understanding of this, consider the following scenario. A person accustomed to living in a forest is transferred to a metropolis where the dynamics of the environment are different. This person might have culture shock at first since they are from a place where formal attire, makeup, and cosmetics are not customary. Further, they are taken to a restaurant, the customers are greeted and treated well, food is serviced in a dining table, there is a chair with a smooth sofa, a chef to cook, a waiter to serve, and other facilities which all come at a cost. This may frighten that individual irrespective of the kind of service being provided. In this case, for those who are privileged and utilize the service of the restaurant regularly, it may be a normal affair. But for this person who has come from a forest, it might come as a shock or a frightening or extreme experience. If the person stays there for long and gets used to this environment and continues availing the restaurant services, there may be change of perception and that would lead towards give me more or make it better. This is a normal natural tendency of a consumer. This has led towards evolution of technology and practices to ensure continual value creation. From this, it is evident to us that value realization is perceived rather than being created

  ## What are Outcomes?

Acting as a service provider, an organization produces outputs that help its consumers to achieve certain outcomes. Let's look at the definition as per ITIL. 
An output is a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity, whereas an outcome is a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs. Let's look at some examples.

Assume for the moment that a company intends to launch an HR internet portal so that workers may report things like leaves of absence, local transportation, etc. Assuming that the current method of doing things by hand is manual and time-consuming resulting in mistakes and delays. Thus, the anticipated outcomes in this case could be an output would be internet portal for claim submission. An outcome would be improved speed of clearance, reduced error, etc. Value or benefits would be increased productivity of employees. Ideally, a value has to be created by utility and warranty of the services with the reduced impact of affected services, cost, and risk where the outcomes should be supportive. This distinction which is clear from the previously given example must be understood. When we discuss such examples which are in a control setting like an organization, it is very simple to see and comprehend the output and outcome. However, in cases where the organization has no easy access to the services like retail services, it is challenging to describe and narrate easily. Organizations do these through survey, consumer feedback, marketing campaign, etc. Let's look at what is utility and warranty.

## What is utility and warranty ?
Utility refers to the features and functionalities of the product or service which offers to meet a particular need of the consumer. Utility addresses the point what the service does and what the service is used to determine. Is the service being fit for purpose? Services with utility must support the performance of the consumer and remove constraints from the consumer or at least one of these.
## Let's look at what is warranty. Warranty 

Refers to assurance that a product or service will provide and meet agreed requirements. This means how the service performs and whether the service is fit for use. Warranty basically refers to and addresses issues of service that is availability, capacity, security and continuity. Let's look at the same example referring to the HR portal scenario. The utility of the portal services can be submission of claims, scanning and uploading of the proof documents, defined templates, speed of processing, etc. Whereas the warranty shall refer to the availability of portal like 24 by 7 available, can provide the concurrent access to thousand users which is also known as capacity. Every user has a unique credentials to log in which represents security. Having a failover to ensure the continuous availability of the services even after primary data center fails due to some reasons. This refers to as continuity.
