Learning objective -

 overview of organizations, service providers, service consumers and other stakeholders. We will also see what is meant by product and services.

## What is organization?

Organization is a person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities, and relationships to achieve its objectives. 
some of the examples of organization to understand it better. Associations, so any association that is formed to achieve an objective is an example of organization- 
Corporations, 
foundation,
even government is an example of organization. Non profit organizations and IT team. So even an IT team is called an organization because it has multiple group of peoples working to achieve an objective.

## Service provider ?

When provisioning the services, an organization takes on the role of the service provider. The provider can be external to the consumer's organization or they can both be part of the same organization. Let's look at an example where an IT team is delivering a service to the external stakeholder, that is external service provider. The example for internal service provider is an IT team providing their service to other departments within an organization, that is, internal service provider.

some of the examples of service providers. Healthcare facilities is also a form of service provision. Financial, cloud service, so in the modern world, we have Amazon Web Services, Azure. All of those are example of cloud service. Network service, Internet service. So these are all the examples of service providers. They make sure they deliver the service to the end user or the consumer and provide the appropriate level of service in a given period of time

## Overview of Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and other Stakeholders Part 2-

## what are all the types of service providers available ?

### Type 1 service provider - 

It  is an internal service provider that is embedded within a business unit. There may be several Type 1 service providers within an organization.

### Type 2 service provider- 

It is an internal service provider that provides shared IT services to more than one business unit. Type 2 service providers are also known as shared service units. In short, they are called as SSU. 

### Type 3 service provider- 

It  is a service provider that provides IT services to external customers. 

Now let's look at the examples of them. Type 1 service provider, internal service providers operate exclusively within their internal market space, which may be an internal business unit called as BU.

You can see that in the diagram represented. When one business unit starts to achieve large business growth and begins earning a big enough portion of the company's profit, that business unit wants to ensure that all necessary resources are under its own direct control. This leads to the creation of sub-departments with the single purpose of providing non-core services to their business unit. Examples are finance and administration, office management, customer care, human resources, fleet management, IT services, etc. You can see the sub-departments mentioned in the diagram. So these sub-departments are known as Type 1 service providers within ITIL best practice.

Let's move to Type 2 service provider, which is shared service units. In most cases, corporate functions such as finance, HR, or IT are not part of the core business service. Therefore, they don't need to be managed directly at the corporate business level. Internal providers are consolidated into a single unit, which will centrally provide the services to the whole organization. Within ITIL, we call those shared service units and they represent the Type 2 service provider archetype

Type 2 service providers have more autonomy in making their own internal strategies, decisions, and organizational structure that will serve business demands in the most efficient and optimized manner. You can see the examples of shared service unit in the diagram represented.

Let's move to third type of service provider, which is external service providers. When services are provided outside the company, it's Type 3 or external service provider. External service providers will deliver the same KPIs or other measurable objectives as Type 2 providers, which adopted best practice frameworks as ITIL. When looking at internal organization, external service providers are similar to Type 2 providers, but for multiple external companies. In the diagram represented, you can see the external service providers mentioned. They provide generic services, so the companies that use them have to find their own way in aligning those services with business needs.


## Overview of Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and other Stakeholders Part 3 -

 let's talk about service consumers and other stakeholders.
 
## Who are all service consumers? 

When receiving services, an organization takes on the role of the service consumer. Let's look at some examples of service consumers. 

In retail, customers are called as service consumer. In health care, the patients who are receiving the treatment is called as service consumer. In education, the students who enroll for the courses are called as service consumers.

Mobile phone users are called as service consumers. Television channel subscribers are called as service consumers.

In an IT environment, the end users who use the services of IT are called as service consumers.

Let's look at the two types of consumers according to ITIL. 

## 1- One is the internal consumers
## 2- other one is an external consumers

## who are all internal consumers?

Any service provider organization will have its own users who need to be taken care of. The users could be part of the support team or from project teams.

As you service the users within your own organization, these customers are called as internal customers.

## who are all the external service consumers? 

If the consumer resides outside the IT service provider organization, then the consumer is called as an external customer. The external consumer pay for the services with a set SLAs and they tend to impose penalties when the service targets are not met.

Let's also look at some key definitions in ITIL with respect to service consumers-

Number 1 is a customer-  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcome of the service consumption is called a customer.


### User - User is a person who uses these services. Sponsor. Sponsor is a person who authorizes the budget for service consumptions. Let's look at the real world example of customer, user, and sponsor. 

For example, in an IT organization, they plan to purchase a laptop for their end users. They approach the laptop manufacturing company and they procure a set of laptops for their end users. Here the laptop manufacturer is the service provider. The IT team which procures the laptop is the service consumer. Or here, as per the ITIL definition, they are called as customer.

## Who is the user?

The end user who are going to use the laptop is called as user as per the ITIL definition. Before procuring the laptop, there will be an approval process in place where the business unit head will review the quotation and he will allocate budget to procure the laptops. This person is called as a sponsor.

Let's move to other stakeholders.

Beyond the consumer and provider roles, there are usually many other stakeholders that are important to value creation. Let's look at some examples. Individual employees of the provider organization , partners and suppliers, investors and shareholders, government organizations such as regulators , and social groups.

Let's look at the internal stakeholders. They are those that work within the same organization. Let's think of the employees of the ITIL within organization, the team, the management, the partners, et cetera. When speaking about internal IT providers, they can also be the internal customers. Let's look at who are all the external stakeholders. They are those that are not part of the same organization and these stakeholders can be external customers or they can be users, suppliers, and vendors
