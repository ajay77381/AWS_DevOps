## Introduction to Technical Management Practices

Technical management practices are adapted from technology management domains for service management purposes.
Technical management is a set of processes that govern how IT organizations set up and deploy the technological core of their systems. 
The ITIL defines technical management as a function. Thus, when the ITIL refers to technical management practices, it's focusing specifically on the people and tools who will implement those processes. Technical management also plays a role in keeping the systems up to date and upgrading to newer technologies when they become available.
