# Steps of Booting
We can describe the boot process in six steps:

1. The Startup
It is the first step that involves switching the power ON. It supplies electricity to the main components like BIOS and processor.

2. BIOS: Power On Self Test
It is an initial test performed by the BIOS. Further, this test performs an initial check on the input/output devices, computerâ€™s main memory, disk drives, etc. Moreover, if any error occurs, the system produces a beep sound.

3. Loading of OS
In this step, the operating system is loaded into the main memory. The operating system starts working and executes all the initial files and instructions.

4. System Configuration
In this step, the drivers are loaded into the main memory. Drivers are programs that help in the functioning of the peripheral devices.

5. Loading System Utilities
System utilities are basic functioning programs, for example, volume control, antivirus, etc. In this step, system utilities are loaded into the memory.

6. User Authentication
If any password has been set up in the computer system, the system checks for user authentication. Once the user enters the login Id and password correctly the system finally starts.
