P1 (Priority 1):
- Critical priority.
- Indicates a major issue that impacts the entire business or a large group of users.
- Causes complete service outage or significant disruption to critical business operations.
- Requires immediate attention and is often worked on 24/7 until resolved.
- Example: A company-wide server or network failure.


P2 (Priority 2):
High priority, but less severe than P1.
Represents a high-impact issue affecting multiple users or services, but not a complete outage.
The issue affects business operations but does not stop them entirely.
Resolution is urgent, but it might not require 24/7 attention.
Example: A department's network connection is down, but the rest of the company can function.
