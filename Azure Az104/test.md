What If an Interviewer Asked: You Lost Your AWS EC2 Key Pair—Now What?"

 5 Steps to Recover SSH Access to Your EC2 Instance

1️⃣ Create an AMI of the Instance

Go to your EC2 dashboard, select the instance, and create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Use default settings for simplicity.

2️⃣ Wait for the AMI to Be Ready

Check the AMI status in the AMI section—it will show Available when it’s ready

3️⃣ Launch a New Instance Using the AMI

Use the AMI you just created (instead of Amazon Linux or Ubuntu default AMIs) when launching a new instance.

4️⃣ Generate a New Key Pair

During the launch process, create and download a fresh key pair. This will be your new access key.

5️⃣ Launch the New Instance

Start the instance, SSH into it with the new key, and all your data and configurations are intact!

💡 Why This Method?
✔️ It’s quick and easy.
✔️ No swapping or mounting volumes.
