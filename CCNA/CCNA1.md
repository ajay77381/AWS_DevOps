Networking- When two or more system connected together is called network and share the information one to another computer is called networking.

### Type of Networking-

There are two type of networking

1- Point to point networking
2- Multipoint networking

Point to point networking :- A point to point networking two device are connected each other and exchang their information on one device to other.

Multipoint networking:- In multipoint networking two or more device are connected each other and they transfer data one computer to another.

What is Topolocy ?

Topology is a structure of network is other words topology mena way of connecting the computer.

 There are two type of topology 
 1- Physical topology 
 2- Logical topology

 OSI model

 Open system interconnection model developed by the international standard organization (ISO) describe the flow of information from one computer to another. OSI model also called iso , osi model 
 It is conceptual model that has 7layers.

 7- application layter
 6- Presentation layer
 5- Session Layer
 4- Transport Layer 
 3- Network Layer
 2-Data layer 
 1- Physical Layer


1-Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model. This layer is use to established or terminate the communication media.

Responsblity of the Physical Layer are:

characteristics of media
Encoding
Transmission rate

The diffrent type of transmission mode are 

Half duplex
Simples
Full duplex


Data linkk Layer-

Data link layter is the second layer of osi model. It handel the data transmission between network and physical layter. Data unit at the data linklayer is called as frame. Data link layter receive the data from network layer.

Responsblity of the data link layter-

Framing 
physical addressign
access control
flo control
error control

Transport Layter- This is the fourth layter of the osi model . The data unit of this layer is know as segment. The network layer deals with source to destinision delivery of individual packets and does not recognastion ay relation ship betwwen them and on the other hand transport layter ensure that the entirre message reach and order handel error control and flow control at the source to destinision.
